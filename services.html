<p>
WLT's goal is to expose more people to the large and wondrous world of tea.
There are hundreds of different teas in the world, each with its own unique flavor
profile

There's nothing quite as good as a perfectly made cup of tea. At least, that's what
Isabelle believes. Through tea tastings Isabelle engages her customers in the world
of tea, </p>

<h3>What service do you provide?</h3>
<p>Our main focus is on tea tastings. Tea tastings are lead by Isabelle, who engages
all you senses while preparing beautiful teas. Isabelle also teaches classes about tea.
Her previous experience includes teaching classes for a parks and recreation program,
her classes use tea tasting as a focal point for learning. Using each tasting as a way
to connect the material to a more memorable sensory experience.</p>

<h3>How does a tasting work?</h3>
<p>Isabelle uses a Gung Fu set, a traditional Chinese style of brewing tea, for her
tastings. During an hour tasting she'll prepare 2-3 different teas in front of you,
while walking you through what she's doing, what the teas are, and where they come from.
All while sharing her extensive knowledge of tea.</p>

<h3>Why should I be interested in this service?</h3>
<p>In the Napa valley we're surrounded by fine wines, teas run along a similar vein.
Isabelle strives to provide a professional and high quality experience, similar to
a fine wine tasting. There are a huge variety of teas in the world, and we want to
expose more people to the world of tea. In a place as deeply connected to wine as Napa,
it's sometimes nice to have something different. Tea tastings provides the high quality,
professional experience we expect synonymous with the Napa Valley.</p>
