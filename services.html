<div class="big">T</div>here's nothing quite as good as a perfectly made cup of tea. At least, that's what
Isabelle believes. Through tea tastings Isabelle aims to expose more people to the large and wondrous world of tea.

<h3 style="clear:both;">What service do you provide?</h3>
<p>Our main focus is on tea tastings. Tea tastings are lead by Isabelle, who engages
all you senses while preparing beautiful teas. Isabelle also teaches classes about tea.
Her previous experience includes teaching classes for a parks and recreation program,
her classes use tea tasting as a focal point for learning. Using each tasting as a way
to connect the material to a more memorable sensory experience.</p>


<h3>How does a tasting work?</h3>
<p>Isabelle uses a Gung Fu set, a traditional Chinese style of brewing tea, for her
tastings. During an hour tasting she'll prepare 2-3 different teas in front of you,
while walking you through what she's doing, what the teas are, and where they come from.
All while sharing her extensive knowledge of tea.</p>


<h3>Why should I be interested in this service?</h3>
<p>Most people have had tea before, and when we think of tea, we most commonly think of tea bags
you buy at the supermarket. Though supermarket tea has increased in quality 
and variety in the last few years, there is still an entire world of tea that
most people haven't explored. Isabelle would like to expand your tea horizons
in a engaging way, that showcases how wonderfully unique tea is. Isabelle 
strives for you to walk away from each tasting with a better understanding,
and deeper appreciation for tea.
