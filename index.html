<p>WLT's goal is to expose more people to the large and wondrous world of tea.
There are hundreds of different teas in the world, each with its own unique flavor
profile

There's nothing quite as good as a perfectly made cup of tea. At least, that's what
Isabelle believes. Through tea tastings Isabelle engages her customers in the world
of tea, </p>

<h3>What service do you provide?</h3>
<p>Our main focus is on tea tastings. Tea tastings are lead by Isabelle, who engages
all you senses while preparing beautiful teas. Isabelle also teaches classes about tea.
Her previous experience includes teaching classes for a parks and recreation program,
her classes use tea tasting as a focal point for learning. Using each tasting as a way
to connect the material to a more memorable sensory experience.</p>
