<p>Isabelle started her journey in to the world of teas as a senior in high school. Her
senior project was about exploring tea, and her last semester was devoted completely to
her project. During her project she interned at a tea company, and traveled to London to
study afternoon teas. Her project was finished by a 50 minute presentation to her high
school.</p>

<p>Since then she's discovered a love of tea, and has continued explore and learn more
about tea. In the summer of 2016 she was given the opportunity to teach a class about
tea for the Yountville Parks and Recreation department.  Since then she's continued
teaching classes, and has set out to share her passion for tea with others.</p>

From an interview of Sam Holland by Devon Avery in the Yountville Sun
"Volunteering at the Kiwanis Crab Feed last year, Sam and 
Isabelle Bardessono were talking about Isabelle's passion for tea. 
'She was so knowledgeable,' Sam remarked. 'I asked her if she'd teach a
class.' Now "Exploring the World of Tea" is so popular, there's a wait 
list."
