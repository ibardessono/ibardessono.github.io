<h3>Who is Isabelle?</h3>
<p>Isabelle started her journey in to the world of teas as a senior in high school. Her
senior project was about exploring tea, and her last semester was devoted completely to
her project. During her project she interned at a tea company, and traveled to London to
study afternoon teas. Her project was finished by a 50 minute presentation to her high
school.</p>

<p>Since then she's discovered a love of tea, and has continued explore and learn more
about tea. In the summer of 2016 she was given the opportunity to teach a class about
tea for the Yountville Parks and Recreation department.  Since then she's continued
teaching classes, and has set out to share her passion for tea with others.</p>
